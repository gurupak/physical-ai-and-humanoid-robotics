## Prompt

```text
## Goal
Initialize a Docusaurus 3.9.x documentation site with TypeScript, deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

## User Stories
1. As a developer, I can clone the repo, run `npm install && npm start`, and see the site locally at localhost:3000
2. As a developer, when I push to `main`, GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys to GitHub Pages
3. As a visitor, I can access the site at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` and see the homepage

## Functional Requirements

### R1: Repository Setup
- Initialize Git repository with `.gitignore` (node_modules, build, .docusaurus, .cache-loader)
- README.md with setup instructions

### R2: Docusaurus Scaffold
- Use: `npx create-docusaurus@latest . classic --typescript`
- Version: @docusaurus/core ^3.9.2, @docusaurus/preset-classic ^3.9.2
- React 18.x (confirmed compatible with Docusaurus 3.x)
- Config file: `docusaurus.config.ts` (ESM with TypeScript)

### R3: Docs-Only Mode Configuration
In docusaurus.config.ts:
- Set `docs.routeBasePath: '/'` (docs serve from root URL)
- Set `blog: false` (disable blog feature)
- Keep `pages: false` or minimal (no custom pages needed initially)
- Set `sidebarPath: './sidebars.ts'`

### R4: Project Structure
[Full structure omitted for brevity - see user input]

### R5: Homepage Configuration
In docusaurus.config.ts:
- title: "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"
- tagline: "A comprehensive guide to building intelligent robots"
- url: "https://<username>.github.io"
- baseUrl: "/<repo-name>/"
- organizationName: "<github-username>"
- projectName: "<repo-name>"

### R6: GitHub Actions Workflow
File: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Trigger: push to `main` branch
- Node.js 20.x
- Steps: checkout → setup node → npm ci → npm run build → deploy to gh-pages branch
- Use: `actions/deploy-pages@v4` or `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3`

### R7: Sidebar Configuration
File: `sidebars.ts`
- Single sidebar named `tutorialSidebar`
- Initially contains only `intro` document
- Type: autogenerated from docs/ folder structure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `npm install` completes without errors
- [ ] `npm start` launches dev server at localhost:3000
- [ ] Homepage shows title "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"
- [ ] Push to main triggers GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] GitHub Pages serves the built site
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`npm run build` passes)
- [ ] Console shows no errors in browser

## Out of Scope (Deferred to Later Specs)
- Actual chapter content (just placeholder)
- Dark/light mode customization
- Tailwind CSS integration
- ChatKit/chatbot integration
- Authentication (Better-Auth)
- Urdu translation/i18n
- Progress tracking
- Custom styling beyond defaults

## Technical Notes
- Docusaurus 3.9.x uses ESM (`export default`) not CommonJS
- TypeScript config uses `docusaurus.config.ts` not `.js`
- GitHub Pages requires `baseUrl` to match repo name for project sites
```

## Response snapshot

Successfully created feature specification for Docusaurus 3.9.x site initialization.

**Key Outputs**:
1. **Feature Branch**: Created `001-docusaurus-init`
2. **Specification Document**: `specs/001-docusaurus-init/spec.md` (177 lines)
   - 3 prioritized user stories (P1: Local Dev Setup, P2: Automated Deployment, P3: Public Access)
   - 24 functional requirements covering repository structure, configuration, deployment
   - 8 measurable success criteria (technology-agnostic)
   - 5 edge cases identified
   - 10 documented assumptions
   - Clear scope boundaries

3. **Quality Validation**: `specs/001-docusaurus-init/checklists/requirements.md`
   - All checklist items passed ✅
   - Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
   - Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
   - Status: **PASSED** - Ready for planning phase

**Specification Highlights**:
- **Independent Testability**: Each user story (P1, P2, P3) delivers standalone value and can be tested independently
- **Measurable Outcomes**: SC-001 through SC-008 include specific metrics (time, percentages, zero-error targets)
- **Technology-Agnostic Success Criteria**: Focus on user-facing outcomes (setup time < 5 min, load time < 3 sec) not implementation details
- **Comprehensive Edge Cases**: Build failures, branch triggers, empty docs, misconfiguration, version mismatches
- **Clear Assumptions**: Documents reasonable defaults (GitHub repo exists, Node 20.x, Pages enabled) without requiring user clarification

**No Blockers**: Specification is complete and validated. Ready to proceed to `/sp.plan` for implementation planning.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete feature specification created with 3 prioritized user stories, 24 functional requirements, and 8 success criteria
- 🧪 Tests: Specification quality validation completed - all checklist items passed (content quality, requirement completeness, feature readiness)
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/001-docusaurus-init/spec.md` (177 lines) and `specs/001-docusaurus-init/checklists/requirements.md` (validation checklist)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan, or `/sp.clarify` if refinements needed (none required based on validation)
- 🧠 Reflection: Zero clarification markers needed - user input was comprehensive with clear requirements. Spec maintains proper separation between business value (Success Criteria) and technical details (Functional Requirements). Prioritized user stories follow MVP principle (P1 enables P2 enables P3).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification creation completed successfully on first iteration
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual quality validation PASS - all 12 checklist items passed including content quality, requirement completeness, and feature readiness
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow with comprehensive user input including functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and out-of-scope items
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to planning phase with `/sp.plan` to generate implementation tasks based on validated specification
