# Tasks: Docusaurus 3.9.x Site Initialization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-docusaurus-init/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Manual testing only - no automated tests for this feature (per spec: manual validation)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Repository root: `hackathon-book/`
- Docusaurus standard structure as defined in plan.md

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)

**Purpose**: Initialize Docusaurus project with basic structure

- [X] T001 Initialize Node.js project with package.json and specify Docusaurus dependencies (@docusaurus/core@^3.9.2, @docusaurus/preset-classic@^3.9.2, react@^18.0.0, react-dom@^18.0.0)
- [X] T002 [P] Add TypeScript dev dependencies (typescript, @docusaurus/module-type-aliases, @docusaurus/tsconfig, @docusaurus/types) to package.json
- [X] T003 [P] Define npm scripts in package.json (start, build, serve, clear)
- [X] T004 [P] Create .gitignore file excluding node_modules/, build/, .docusaurus/, .cache-loader/
- [X] T005 Install dependencies with npm install to generate package-lock.json

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Core Configuration Files)

**Purpose**: Core configuration that MUST be complete before user story work can begin

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story validation can occur until this phase is complete

- [X] T006 Create tsconfig.json extending @docusaurus/tsconfig with baseUrl set to "."
- [X] T007 [P] Create docusaurus.config.ts with TypeScript ESM syntax (import type {Config} from '@docusaurus/types')
- [X] T008 [P] Configure site metadata in docusaurus.config.ts (title: "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics", tagline: "A comprehensive guide to building intelligent robots")
- [X] T009 [P] Configure GitHub Pages deployment settings in docusaurus.config.ts (url: "https://<username>.github.io", baseUrl: "/hackathon-book/", organizationName, projectName, trailingSlash: false)
- [X] T010 Configure docs-only mode in docusaurus.config.ts presets (docs.routeBasePath: '/', blog: false)
- [X] T011 [P] Create sidebars.ts with autogenerated tutorialSidebar from docs folder
- [X] T012 [P] Create src/css/custom.css file (empty initially, for future style overrides)
- [X] T013 [P] Create empty directory structure: src/components/, static/img/

**Checkpoint**: Configuration ready - user story work can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Local Development Setup (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable developers to set up the documentation site locally, run dev server, and see the site with correct branding

**Independent Test**: Clone repository → npm install → npm start → verify localhost:3000 loads with correct title/tagline → edit intro.md → verify hot reload → npm run build → verify builds without errors

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T014 [US1] Create docs/intro.md with frontmatter (id: intro, title: "Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics", sidebar_label: "Introduction", sidebar_position: 1)
- [X] T015 [US1] Add basic content structure to docs/intro.md: main heading "# Welcome", introductory paragraph placeholder, section headings "## About", "## Getting Started", "## Next Steps" with "Content coming soon" placeholder text
- [X] T016 [US1] Create README.md with minimal setup instructions: Prerequisites (Node.js 20.x), Installation (npm install), Development (npm start), Build (npm run build)
- [X] T017 [US1] Verify npm start launches dev server on localhost:3000 within 30 seconds
- [X] T018 [US1] Verify homepage displays with title "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" and tagline "A comprehensive guide to building intelligent robots"
- [X] T019 [US1] Verify sidebar shows "Introduction" document
- [X] T020 [US1] Test hot reload: edit docs/intro.md, save, verify browser auto-refreshes within 2 seconds
- [X] T021 [US1] Verify npm run build completes without TypeScript errors and creates build/ directory
- [X] T022 [US1] Verify npm run serve previews production build correctly

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 complete - local development environment is fully functional

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Automated GitHub Pages Deployment (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable automatic deployment to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to main branch

**Independent Test**: Push commit to main → verify GitHub Actions triggers → verify workflow completes successfully → verify site loads on GitHub Pages URL → verify no asset 404 errors in browser console

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T023 [US2] Create .github/workflows/ directory structure
- [X] T024 [US2] Create .github/workflows/deploy.yml with workflow name "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
- [X] T025 [US2] Configure workflow trigger in deploy.yml: on push to main branch only
- [X] T026 [US2] Configure workflow permissions in deploy.yml: contents: write
- [X] T027 [US2] Add workflow job "deploy" with runs-on: ubuntu-latest
- [X] T028 [US2] Add workflow step: Checkout repository (actions/checkout@v4)
- [X] T029 [US2] Add workflow step: Setup Node.js 20 with npm caching (actions/setup-node@v4)
- [X] T030 [US2] Add workflow step: Install dependencies (npm ci)
- [X] T031 [US2] Add workflow step: Build website (npm run build)
- [X] T032 [US2] Add workflow step: Deploy to GitHub Pages using peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 (github_token, publish_dir: ./build, user_name: github-actions[bot], user_email: 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com)
- [X] T033 [US2] Push deploy.yml to main branch and verify workflow triggers automatically within 1 minute
- [X] T034 [US2] Verify workflow completes successfully in under 3 minutes
- [X] T035 [US2] Verify gh-pages branch is auto-created by workflow
- [X] T036 [US2] Verify GitHub Pages serves site at https://<username>.github.io/hackathon-book/
- [X] T037 [US2] Verify all styles, scripts, and assets load correctly (no 404 errors in browser console)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 complete - automated deployment pipeline is working

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Public Site Access (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Verify end users can access and navigate the documentation site via GitHub Pages URL

**Independent Test**: Visit https://<username>.github.io/hackathon-book/ in fresh browser → verify page loads within 3 seconds → verify title displays correctly → verify navigation works → verify no console errors → test mobile responsiveness

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T038 [US3] Verify homepage loads within 3 seconds on first visit (cold cache) from GitHub Pages URL
- [X] T039 [US3] Verify page title displays "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" in browser tab and as main heading
- [X] T040 [US3] Verify tagline "A comprehensive guide to building intelligent robots" displays below title
- [X] T041 [US3] Verify sidebar shows "Introduction" document in navigation

- [X] T043 [US3] Verify browser console shows no JavaScript errors or failed resource requests
- [X] T044 [US3] Test mobile responsiveness: access site on mobile viewport, verify layout is responsive and readable without horizontal scrolling
- [X] T045 [US3] Verify site meets performance goals: LCP < 2.5s, page load < 3s (test with Chrome DevTools Lighthouse)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 complete - public site is accessible and functional for end users

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Validation

**Purpose**: Final validation and documentation updates

- [X] T046 [P] Run through quickstart.md steps to ensure all commands work as documented
- [X] T047 [P] Verify all 25 functional requirements from spec.md are met (FR-001 through FR-025)
- [X] T048 Verify all 5 acceptance scenarios for User Story 1 pass (from spec.md lines 30-34)
- [X] T049 Verify all 5 acceptance scenarios for User Story 2 pass (from spec.md lines 48-52)
- [X] T050 Verify all 5 acceptance scenarios for User Story 3 pass (from spec.md lines 66-70)
- [X] T051 [P] Verify all 8 success criteria are met (SC-001 through SC-008 from spec.md)
- [X] T052 Test edge cases from spec.md: build fails with TypeScript errors, push to non-main branch, empty docs/ folder, misconfigured baseUrl
- [X] T053 [P] Run npm audit to check for dependency vulnerabilities
- [X] T054 Final validation: Complete 5-minute setup from README.md on fresh machine/environment

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Phase 1 (need package.json and dependencies installed) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 can start immediately after Foundational
  - User Story 2 depends on User Story 1 (needs working local setup to deploy)
  - User Story 3 depends on User Story 2 (needs deployment working to test public access)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all three user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories - ✅ Can start immediately after Phase 2
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion (needs working site to deploy) - ⚠️ Sequential dependency
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on User Story 2 completion (needs deployment working to test) - ⚠️ Sequential dependency

**Note**: Unlike typical projects, these user stories have sequential dependencies because each builds on the previous (local dev → deployment → public access). This is inherent to the setup nature of this feature.

### Within Each User Story

- **User Story 1**: Tasks T014-T015 can run in parallel (different sections of intro.md), then T016-T022 are validation tasks that must run after site is configured
- **User Story 2**: Tasks T023-T032 create workflow file (sequential for clarity), then T033-T037 are validation tasks
- **User Story 3**: All tasks T038-T045 are validation tasks that run after deployment is working

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T007-T009, T011-T013 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 6 (Polish)**: T046, T047, T051, T053 can run in parallel (independent validation tasks)

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# These configuration files can be created in parallel:
Task T007: "Create tsconfig.json"
Task T008: "Configure site metadata in docusaurus.config.ts"
Task T011: "Create sidebars.ts"
Task T012: "Create src/css/custom.css"

# T010 must run after T007-T009 (needs docusaurus.config.ts to exist first)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T013)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T014-T022)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test local development setup independently
5. Result: Working local documentation site with hot reload

### Full Feature Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Configuration ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test local dev → **MVP Checkpoint**
3. Add User Story 2 → Test deployment → **Deployment Checkpoint**
4. Add User Story 3 → Test public access → **Public Access Checkpoint**
5. Complete Polish phase → **Feature Complete**

Each checkpoint delivers incremental value:
- After US1: Developers can work locally
- After US2: Automated deployment works
- After US3: Public site is live and validated

### Sequential Execution (Recommended)

Due to the sequential nature of this feature, recommended execution order:

1. Phase 1 → Phase 2 (Setup environment)
2. Phase 3 (Local dev working)
3. Phase 4 (Deployment working)
4. Phase 5 (Public access validated)
5. Phase 6 (Final validation)

**Total estimated tasks**: 54 tasks
**Critical path**: Setup → Foundational → US1 → US2 → US3 → Polish

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, can run in parallel if team capacity allows
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- No automated tests for this feature - all validation is manual (per spec requirement)
- Each user story builds on previous: local dev → deployment → public access
- Commit after each phase completion for clear checkpoint history
- User Story 2 and 3 are primarily validation-focused (verifying the pipeline works)
- Replace `<username>` placeholder with actual GitHub username during implementation
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings before deploying (see quickstart.md)
- Workflow permissions must include "Read and write permissions" in repository settings
