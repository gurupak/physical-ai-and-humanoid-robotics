# Module 2: The Digital Twin - Gazebo & Unity Simulation

A digital twin is a virtual replica of your robot that behaves exactly like the real thing. In this module, you'll learn to build simulation environments that help you test algorithms safely before deploying to physical hardware.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
- Choose between Gazebo (physics-first) and Unity (visual-first) based on your project needs
- Build basic simulation worlds for robotics testing
- Create simple sensor models for LiDAR and cameras
- Connect your simulation to ROS2 workflows
