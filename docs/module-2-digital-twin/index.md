# Module 2: The Digital Twin - Gazebo & Unity Simulation

A digital twin is a virtual replica of your robot that behaves exactly like the real thing. In this module, you'll learn to build simulation environments that help you test algorithms safely before deploying to physical hardware.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
- Choose between Gazebo (physics-first) and Unity (visual-first) based on your project needs
- Build basic simulation worlds for robotics testing
- Create simple sensor models for LiDAR and cameras
- Connect your simulation to ROS2 workflows

## Quick Start Guide

New to simulation? Start here:
1. Read [Digital Twin Basics](./digital-twin-intro) to understand when to use each platform
2. Try the [Gazebo Physics Tutorial](./gazebo-physics) to build your first robot world
3. Explore [Unity Setup](./unity-rendering) for visual AI training

## System Requirements

**For Gazebo:**
- Ubuntu 20.04+ or Windows with WSL2
- 8GB RAM minimum
- ROS2 installed (from Module 1)

**For Unity:**
- Windows 10+ or macOS 11+
- Unity 2021.3 LTS or newer
- 4GB+ GPU memory for rendering
